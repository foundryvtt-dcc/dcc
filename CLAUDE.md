# CLAUDE.md

Quick reference for Claude Code working with the DCC system for FoundryVTT.

## Quick Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Run all tests (unit + integration) |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run unit tests only (mocked Foundry) |
| `npm run test:integration` | Run integration tests only (real Foundry) |
| `npm run setup:foundry` | Setup Foundry for integration tests |
| `npm run format` | Format code (StandardJS + StyleLint) |
| `npm run scss` | Compile SASS to CSS |
| `npm run todb` | Compile JSON → LevelDB packs (Foundry must be shut down) |
| `npm run tojson` | Extract LevelDB → JSON packs |
| `npm run compare-lang` | Check translation coverage |

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `module/dcc.js` | Entry point, system init |
| `module/actor.js` | DCCActor class |
| `module/item.js` | DCCItem class |
| `template.json` | Data model definition |
| `styles/dcc.scss` | Main styles (edit this, not .css) |

## Critical Rules

- **SCSS only**: Edit `styles/dcc.scss`, never `styles/dcc.css`
- **i18n required**: All user text must use `game.i18n.localize()`
- **Translate new keys**: When adding to language files, translate them
- **Tests must pass**: All PRs require passing tests
- **FoundryVTT v14**: Target version (v14-only, ApplicationV2 API)
- **Check dependent modules**: Before PRs, verify no breakage in `../../modules/dcc-qol`, `../../modules/xcc`, `../../mcc-classes`, `../../dcc-crawl-classes`

## Working with dcc-core-lib

We own `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` (the upstream library is at
`/Users/timwhite/WebstormProjects/dcc-core-lib`, repo
`moonloch/dcc-core-lib`). When investigating roll/check/save/combat
behavior and the bug appears to be in the lib (not just an adapter
translation issue):

- **Fix it in dcc-core-lib.** Open a PR against `moonloch/dcc-core-lib`
  with the fix + a regression test. Do not paper over lib bugs with
  adapter-side compensation as a permanent solution. (Short-lived
  workarounds in the adapter are OK while the lib PR is in flight,
  but the workaround must be removed once the fix lands.)
- **Vendor sync.** The lib's compiled output lives at
  `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/` and is committed to the system repo
  (Foundry has no bundler). After the lib PR merges and you've pulled
  `main` in the lib checkout, run `npm run sync-core-lib` from the
  system repo. The script (`scripts/sync-core-lib.mjs`) builds the
  lib via `npm run build`, copies `dist/` into the vendor directory,
  and writes `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/VERSION.json` with the
  source commit SHA + timestamp. Override the source path with
  `DCC_CORE_LIB_SRC=/path/to/dcc-core-lib npm run sync-core-lib`.
  Commit the resulting vendor diff with a message like
  `vendor: sync dcc-core-lib to <version> (<sha7>)`.
- **Adapter cleanup follows the sync.** Once the new vendor copy is
  in place, remove any temporary adapter workaround you added while
  the lib fix was in flight, and update tests that were asserting
  the workaround's compensated values back to the natural contract.

## Standing authorizations

These override the default "never commit/push without being asked"
rule. They apply only to the scoped context described.

- **Auto-commit and push refactor slices on `refactor/dcc-core-lib-adapter`.**
  When a Phase-N session-M slice is complete (code + tests + docs,
  all green), commit and push without asking. Commit-message format
  matches the established history on this branch:
  `feat(adapter): Phase <N> session <M> — <short slice description>`
  (optionally followed by a second `docs(adapter): refresh session-start
  prompt for Phase <N> session <M>` commit if `docs/01-session-start.md`
  was updated). Push to `origin refactor/dcc-core-lib-adapter` after
  the commit(s) land. Still pause and ask if: tests are failing,
  `git status` shows unexpected untracked files, the pre-commit hook
  rewrites code in ways that should be reviewed, or the slice is
  incomplete.

## Refactor-slice testing requirements

Apply to every slice on `refactor/dcc-core-lib-adapter`. These are
preconditions for the auto-commit authorization above — if any fail,
don't commit.

- **Run the FULL browser-tests/e2e Playwright suite each session.**
  Not just `phase1-adapter-dispatch.spec.js` — also `v14-features.spec.js`,
  `data-models.spec.js`, and every other spec in `browser-tests/e2e/`.
  Launch via the standard recipe in
  `docs/dev/TESTING.md#browser-tests-playwright` (Node 24, fvtt CLI
  `installPath=foundry-14` + `dataPath=/Users/timwhite/FoundryVTT-Next`,
  `--world=v14`), then `cd browser-tests/e2e && npm test` (no spec
  filter). Also run the visual-regression suite in
  `browser-tests/visual-regression/` if the slice touches sheet
  markup / chat templates / CSS. Report any failure, even if
  apparently unrelated to the slice — pre-existing flakes are worth
  flagging and pin-pointing, not ignoring.
- **Extend the browser tests each session.** Every slice must add
  at least one new browser-test assertion exercising the new
  behavior end-to-end against live Foundry. For dispatch changes,
  extend `phase1-adapter-dispatch.spec.js` with the new branch. For
  data / sheet / chat-template changes, add cases to the appropriate
  spec (`v14-features.spec.js`, `data-models.spec.js`, or a new
  spec file if the surface area warrants one). The adapter-dispatch
  test count has climbed with each session (26 at Phase 3 session 2
  close → 33 at session 6 close); that trajectory is expected and
  intentional — the suite IS the regression net for the refactor.

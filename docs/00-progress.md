# Refactor Progress — `refactor/dcc-core-lib-adapter`

> **Handoff artifact.** Update at the end of every work session and after any
> significant decision. Future Claude sessions rely on this — without it,
> context is lost each time.

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Prep.** Awaiting review of this session's work before Phase 1.

Per the 7-phase plan in `docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE_REIMAGINED.md §7`:
> Phase 0: fix halfling bug · add dcc-core-lib · adapter scaffolding ·
> document hooks + game.dcc exports.

## Done

### Session 2026-04-17 (first session)

- Created worktree on branch `refactor/dcc-core-lib-adapter` off `main`
  (`2337ec0`). Worktree now lives at
  `/Users/timwhite/FoundryVTT-Next/Data/systems/dcc` (moved 2026-04-17 —
  see Decisions §1 for the updated location rationale).
- Committed architecture doc at `docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE_REIMAGINED.md`
  (**32a5f79**).
- Phase 0 scaffolding + audit committed as **6b433a3**.
- Wired `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` via `npm link` (see §Decisions about the
  scoped name). Verified runtime resolution — library imports succeed.
  Re-linked from the new worktree location on 2026-04-17 after the move
  (the original link didn't travel with the worktree because
  `node_modules/` isn't tracked). Current symlink:
  `node_modules/@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` →
  `/Users/timwhite/WebstormProjects/dcc-core-lib`.
- Created Phase 0 adapter stubs under `module/adapter/`:
  - `character-accessors.mjs` — Foundry actor shape → lib `Character` via
    `CharacterAccessors`
  - `foundry-roller.mjs` — wraps `DCCRoll.createRoll` as the lib's custom
    roller
  - `foundry-events.mjs` — bridges lib event callbacks to Foundry `Hooks`
  - `foundry-data-loader.mjs` — Foundry compendia → lib's table /
    progression registries
  - `chat-renderer.mjs` — library result objects → Foundry `ChatMessage`
  - Each contains only a header JSDoc explaining its role. No behavior.
- Audited every emitted hook in `module/` and every `game.dcc.*` export
  against the four sibling modules (dcc-qol, xcc, mcc-classes,
  dcc-crawl-classes) plus content packs. Published as
  `docs/dev/EXTENSION_API.md` with each item tagged **stable**,
  **internal**, or **dead**.
- Halfling i18n fix carried in via `main` — merged as commit `2337ec0`
  before the branch was created, so no extra work needed this session.

## In progress

Nothing carrying over.

## Blockers / open questions

1. ~~**Runtime loading strategy.**~~ **Resolved 2026-04-17: vendor
   approach (option b).** `scripts/sync-core-lib.mjs` builds the linked
   lib and copies its `dist/` into `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/`, which
   is committed. Adapter code imports via relative path
   (`../vendor/dcc-core-lib/index.js`). No bundler added. One sync
   command (`npm run sync-core-lib`) + one commit per lib-version bump.
   Rationale: keeps the "Foundry loads `module/dcc.js` directly"
   invariant; CI needs no `npm link` or unpublished-package handling;
   unit tests and Foundry runtime resolve identically; each
   vendor-update commit is a reviewable pin. Initial sync (0.2.1,
   `fa908c2`) is ~4.3 MB across 577 files (1.3 MB JS, 1.1 MB source
   maps, 0.5 MB `.d.ts`/maps for IDE support). If repo bloat becomes a
   concern later, source maps can be excluded from the sync — costs
   some legibility in Foundry console stack traces.

2. **Package name discrepancy.** The architecture doc and setup instructions
   refer to `dcc-core-lib`, but the actual npm package name is
   `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` (scoped). Imports use the scoped name. The
   unscoped name is not currently published, so CI currently *cannot*
   `npm install` the lib — only `npm link` works. This is entangled with
   the runtime-loading question.

3. **Dead hook `dcc.update`.** XCC listens for this hook
   (`modules/xcc/module/xcc.js:525`), but nothing in the DCC system
   emits it. Either it was removed at some point, or XCC added it
   speculatively. Decide: add the emission back, or coordinate with
   XCC maintainers to remove the listener. Documented in
   `EXTENSION_API.md §Dead`.

4. **Undocumented `game.dcc.*` pieces with heavy XCC usage.** XCC reaches
   into `game.dcc.DCCRoll.cleanFormula`, `game.dcc.DiceChain.bumpDie`,
   `calculateCritAdjustment`, `calculateProportionalCritRange`, and the
   full `FleetingLuck` class (`init`, `updateFlags`, `give`, `enabled`,
   `automationEnabled`). These are now tagged **stable** — removing or
   renaming them breaks XCC. Formal stabilization before Phase 3
   (attack/crit migration) is required because that's where those
   utilities are implicated.

## Decisions made

0. **Runtime loading: vendor the lib's built `dist/`.** See open
   question #1 above for the full rationale. Committed the initial
   sync + `scripts/sync-core-lib.mjs` in a standalone prep commit so
   Phase 1 imports have somewhere to import *from*. The sync script
   reads from `$DCC_CORE_LIB_SRC` (default
   `/Users/timwhite/WebstormProjects/dcc-core-lib`), runs `npm run
   build` inside the lib, wipes and copies `dist/`, and writes a
   `VERSION.json` with `{ name, version, commit, dirty, syncedAt }`.
   `module/vendor/**` added to `standard.ignore` so the linter skips
   vendored output.

1. **Worktree location.** Now at
   `/Users/timwhite/FoundryVTT-Next/Data/systems/dcc`. Main repo remains
   at `/Users/timwhite/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/dcc`.
   *Why:* `FoundryVTT-Next` is a separate Foundry user-data install, so
   the worktree can live under its `systems/` directory without clashing
   with the main repo on `system.json` id (each Foundry install sees
   only its own `systems/` tree). This lets Tim actually run the
   refactored system in Foundry for testing during Phase 1+.
   *History:* originally parked at
   `/Users/timwhite/WebstormProjects/dcc-refactor` on 2026-04-17 to
   avoid `systems/` collisions; moved same day once the separate
   `FoundryVTT-Next` install was set up.

2. **No `package.json` dependency entry this phase.** Adding
   `"@moonloch/dcc-core-lib": "file:../../../WebstormProjects/dcc-core-lib"`
   would break CI (absolute path, ubuntu runner), and `"*"` or any
   registry version fails because the package is unpublished. Chose to
   leave `package.json` alone and document `npm link` in this log.
   Revisit when open question #1 is resolved.

3. **Adapter stubs are empty by design.** The goal of Phase 0 is to lock
   in the *shape* of the adapter layer (which concerns live where) and
   catch any architectural objections before implementation starts in
   Phase 1. Empty stubs give reviewers a file-tree to react to; filled
   stubs would invite relitigation on boilerplate.

4. **Hook categorization method.** "Stable" = emitted *and* actively
   consumed by a sibling module. "Internal" = emitted but no external
   consumer found in the audited modules. "Dead" = listened to
   externally but never emitted (or vice versa). Tagged per-item in
   `docs/dev/EXTENSION_API.md`.

## Next steps

**Stop. Do not start Phase 1 until Tim signs off on Phase 0.**

When Phase 1 kicks off (per architecture doc §7.2):

1. Resolve open question #1 (runtime loading). Whatever the decision,
   land it in a small prep commit so Phase 1's import statements have
   somewhere to import *from*.
2. Start with the easiest roll to migrate: `rollAbilityCheck` →
   `rollCheck('ability:str', character, …)`. Wire it through:
   `character-accessors.mjs` → `foundry-roller.mjs` → the lib → result
   back through `chat-renderer.mjs`. Keep the existing
   `DCCActor.rollAbilityCheck` as a thin wrapper so dcc-qol /
   token-action-hud-dcc keep working.
3. Add one vitest case under `module/tests/` that exercises the whole
   adapter round-trip against a mock actor, to lock the contract before
   migrating the next roll.
4. Repeat for saves, then skill checks, then init. Ship each as a
   separate commit; each should leave the system in a working state.

## Notes for future sessions

- The pre-commit hook runs `npm run format` → `git add .` → `npm test`.
  That `git add .` **will sweep untracked files into the commit**. Before
  committing, either stash or add to `.gitignore`.
- **Lib updates require `npm run sync-core-lib`** to re-vendor
  `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/`. Commit the vendor delta separately
  from any adapter change that depends on it — two commits: `vendor:
  sync dcc-core-lib to <version> (<sha>)` then the adapter change.
  `VERSION.json` records the lib's git SHA and flags `dirty: true` if
  the lib tree had uncommitted changes at sync time (do not release
  from a dirty sync).
- `npm link @moonloch/dcc-core-lib` is no longer required for runtime
  loading (the vendored copy is used instead). It *is* still useful if
  you want TypeScript-aware IDE support against the linked source, but
  nothing in the system imports from `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` at
  runtime anymore — all imports are relative paths into
  `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/`.
- Sibling modules that must keep working:
  - `../../modules/dcc-qol` — attack hook consumer, reaches into
    `DiceChain.bumpDie` + `DCCRoll.createRoll`
  - `../../modules/xcc` — heaviest consumer; variant game fighting the
    system (replaces `CONFIG.Actor.documentClass` globally)
  - `../../modules/mcc-classes` — clean schema-hook consumer
  - `../../modules/dcc-crawl-classes` — clean schema-hook consumer

# Refactor Progress — `refactor/dcc-core-lib-adapter`

> **Handoff artifact.** Update at the end of every work session and after any
> significant decision. Future Claude sessions rely on this — without it,
> context is lost each time.

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Adopt the lib for simple rolls.** `rollAbilityCheck` is
migrated end-to-end. Next up: save throws, skill checks, initiative —
all reusing the wave-1 pattern.

Per the 7-phase plan in `docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE_REIMAGINED.md §7`:
> Phase 1: ability check · save · skill · init through the adapter.

## Done

### Session 2026-04-17 (first session)

- Created worktree on branch `refactor/dcc-core-lib-adapter` off `main`
  (`2337ec0`). Worktree now lives at
  `/Users/timwhite/FoundryVTT-Next/Data/systems/dcc` (moved 2026-04-17 —
  see Decisions §1 for the updated location rationale).
- Committed architecture doc at `docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE_REIMAGINED.md`
  (**32a5f79**).
- Phase 0 scaffolding + audit committed as **6b433a3**.
- Wired `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` via `npm link` (see §Decisions about the
  scoped name). Verified runtime resolution — library imports succeed.
  Re-linked from the new worktree location on 2026-04-17 after the move
  (the original link didn't travel with the worktree because
  `node_modules/` isn't tracked). Current symlink:
  `node_modules/@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` →
  `/Users/timwhite/WebstormProjects/dcc-core-lib`.
- Created Phase 0 adapter stubs under `module/adapter/`:
  - `character-accessors.mjs` — Foundry actor shape → lib `Character` via
    `CharacterAccessors`
  - `foundry-roller.mjs` — wraps `DCCRoll.createRoll` as the lib's custom
    roller
  - `foundry-events.mjs` — bridges lib event callbacks to Foundry `Hooks`
  - `foundry-data-loader.mjs` — Foundry compendia → lib's table /
    progression registries
  - `chat-renderer.mjs` — library result objects → Foundry `ChatMessage`
  - Each contains only a header JSDoc explaining its role. No behavior.
- Audited every emitted hook in `module/` and every `game.dcc.*` export
  against the four sibling modules (dcc-qol, xcc, mcc-classes,
  dcc-crawl-classes) plus content packs. Published as
  `docs/dev/EXTENSION_API.md` with each item tagged **stable**,
  **internal**, or **dead**.
- Halfling i18n fix carried in via `main` — merged as commit `2337ec0`
  before the branch was created, so no extra work needed this session.

### Session 2026-04-18 (second session)

- **Runtime loading resolved** (open question #1). Chose option (b):
  vendor the lib's built `dist/` under `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/`.
  Added `scripts/sync-core-lib.mjs` + `npm run sync-core-lib`. Initial
  vendor commit **fddcf04** (0.2.1, ~4.3 MB).
- **Wave 1 modifier redesign landed in `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib@0.3.0`**
  (commit `93033cb` in the lib repo, follow-up `f78cbdf` for async
  exports). Replaces the flat `RollModifier` with a tagged union of
  seven transformations paired with a structured `ModifierOrigin`.
  Design doc at `dcc-core-lib/docs/MODIFIERS.md`. Staged migration:
  wave 1 (checks, skills, dice, cleric) adopts the new type; combat,
  spells, patron, occupation keep `LegacyRollModifier` until later
  waves.
- **Async siblings added** through the check pipeline:
  `resolveSkillCheckAsync`, `rollCheckAsync`, `rollAbilityCheckAsync`,
  `rollSavingThrowAsync`, `evaluateRollAsync`. Lets the Foundry
  adapter use Foundry's Promise-based Roll.evaluate idiomatically.
- **Vendor re-sync** to 0.3.0 + `f78cbdf`, committed as **c200938**.
- **Phase 1 adapter wired** for `DCCActor.rollAbilityCheck`:
  - `module/adapter/character-accessors.mjs` — `actorToCharacter`
    builds a lib `Character` from DCCActor; handles save-id remap
    (frt/ref/wil ↔ fortitude/reflex/will) and parses signed save
    strings to numbers.
  - `module/adapter/foundry-roller.mjs` — `createFoundryRoller`
    returns an async roller that wraps `new Roll()`, awaits
    `.evaluate()`, stashes the Foundry Roll on a context object.
  - `module/adapter/chat-renderer.mjs` — `renderAbilityCheck` builds
    a ChatMessage with the same flags + speaker the legacy path
    emitted, plus a structured `system.libResult` payload for
    downstream consumers.
  - `DCCActor.rollAbilityCheck` is now a thin dispatcher: the legacy
    path handles `rollUnder`, `showModifierDialog`, and str/agl with
    CheckPenalty display (preserved verbatim as
    `_rollAbilityCheckLegacy`); everything else flows through
    `_rollAbilityCheckViaAdapter`. Public signature unchanged.
- **Tests**: new `module/__tests__/adapter-ability-check.test.js`
  (3 tests) locks the adapter round-trip. Existing `actor.test.js`
  updated to reflect the new dispatch (legacy path for str+penalty
  and lck+rollUnder; adapter for lck default). 683 unit tests pass
  across 19 test files.

## In progress

Nothing carrying over. Phase 1 ability-check migration complete;
next session migrates saves (Phase 1 continuation).

## Blockers / open questions

1. ~~**Runtime loading strategy.**~~ **Resolved 2026-04-17: vendor
   approach (option b).** `scripts/sync-core-lib.mjs` builds the linked
   lib and copies its `dist/` into `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/`, which
   is committed. Adapter code imports via relative path
   (`../vendor/dcc-core-lib/index.js`). No bundler added. One sync
   command (`npm run sync-core-lib`) + one commit per lib-version bump.
   Rationale: keeps the "Foundry loads `module/dcc.js` directly"
   invariant; CI needs no `npm link` or unpublished-package handling;
   unit tests and Foundry runtime resolve identically; each
   vendor-update commit is a reviewable pin. Initial sync (0.2.1,
   `fa908c2`) is ~4.3 MB across 577 files (1.3 MB JS, 1.1 MB source
   maps, 0.5 MB `.d.ts`/maps for IDE support). If repo bloat becomes a
   concern later, source maps can be excluded from the sync — costs
   some legibility in Foundry console stack traces.

2. **Package name discrepancy.** The architecture doc and setup instructions
   refer to `dcc-core-lib`, but the actual npm package name is
   `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` (scoped). Imports use the scoped name. The
   unscoped name is not currently published, so CI currently *cannot*
   `npm install` the lib — only `npm link` works. This is entangled with
   the runtime-loading question.

3. **Dead hook `dcc.update`.** XCC listens for this hook
   (`modules/xcc/module/xcc.js:525`), but nothing in the DCC system
   emits it. Either it was removed at some point, or XCC added it
   speculatively. Decide: add the emission back, or coordinate with
   XCC maintainers to remove the listener. Documented in
   `EXTENSION_API.md §Dead`.

4. **Undocumented `game.dcc.*` pieces with heavy XCC usage.** XCC reaches
   into `game.dcc.DCCRoll.cleanFormula`, `game.dcc.DiceChain.bumpDie`,
   `calculateCritAdjustment`, `calculateProportionalCritRange`, and the
   full `FleetingLuck` class (`init`, `updateFlags`, `give`, `enabled`,
   `automationEnabled`). These are now tagged **stable** — removing or
   renaming them breaks XCC. Formal stabilization before Phase 3
   (attack/crit migration) is required because that's where those
   utilities are implicated.

## Decisions made

0. **Runtime loading: vendor the lib's built `dist/`.** See open
   question #1 above for the full rationale. Committed the initial
   sync + `scripts/sync-core-lib.mjs` in a standalone prep commit so
   Phase 1 imports have somewhere to import *from*. The sync script
   reads from `$DCC_CORE_LIB_SRC` (default
   `/Users/timwhite/WebstormProjects/dcc-core-lib`), runs `npm run
   build` inside the lib, wipes and copies `dist/`, and writes a
   `VERSION.json` with `{ name, version, commit, dirty, syncedAt }`.
   `module/vendor/**` added to `standard.ignore` so the linter skips
   vendored output.

1. **Worktree location.** Now at
   `/Users/timwhite/FoundryVTT-Next/Data/systems/dcc`. Main repo remains
   at `/Users/timwhite/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/dcc`.
   *Why:* `FoundryVTT-Next` is a separate Foundry user-data install, so
   the worktree can live under its `systems/` directory without clashing
   with the main repo on `system.json` id (each Foundry install sees
   only its own `systems/` tree). This lets Tim actually run the
   refactored system in Foundry for testing during Phase 1+.
   *History:* originally parked at
   `/Users/timwhite/WebstormProjects/dcc-refactor` on 2026-04-17 to
   avoid `systems/` collisions; moved same day once the separate
   `FoundryVTT-Next` install was set up.

2. **No `package.json` dependency entry this phase.** Adding
   `"@moonloch/dcc-core-lib": "file:../../../WebstormProjects/dcc-core-lib"`
   would break CI (absolute path, ubuntu runner), and `"*"` or any
   registry version fails because the package is unpublished. Chose to
   leave `package.json` alone and document `npm link` in this log.
   Revisit when open question #1 is resolved.

3. **Adapter stubs are empty by design.** The goal of Phase 0 is to lock
   in the *shape* of the adapter layer (which concerns live where) and
   catch any architectural objections before implementation starts in
   Phase 1. Empty stubs give reviewers a file-tree to react to; filled
   stubs would invite relitigation on boilerplate.

4. **Hook categorization method.** "Stable" = emitted *and* actively
   consumed by a sibling module. "Internal" = emitted but no external
   consumer found in the audited modules. "Dead" = listened to
   externally but never emitted (or vice versa). Tagged per-item in
   `docs/dev/EXTENSION_API.md`.

## Next steps

Phase 1 continuation — migrate the remaining simple rolls to the
adapter, each as its own commit:

1. **`rollSavingThrow`** → `rollSavingThrowAsync(saveId, character, …)`.
   Pattern is identical to ability check: actor → Character →
   `rollSavingThrowAsync` → chat renderer. The save-id remapping
   (frt/ref/wil ↔ fortitude/reflex/will) is already in
   `character-accessors.mjs`. One new test file modeled on
   `adapter-ability-check.test.js`.
2. **`rollSkillCheck`** → `rollCheckAsync` with a SkillDefinition
   derived from the actor's skill item or `system.skills.{id}`.
   `actor.js:1111` (current dispatcher between built-in vs. item
   skills) becomes the adapter boundary. Some skills use custom dice
   (`d14`, `d24`) — the lib's `set-die` modifier handles that.
3. **`rollInit`** → `rollCheckAsync` with `{ ability: 'agl', die:
   actor.system.attributes.init.value }`. Simplest migration. Chat
   message must preserve the flags the combat tracker reads.

Each commit leaves the system shippable. After these four, Phase 1
is complete and review/signoff gate before Phase 2 (spell checks).

**Cross-repo coordination:** if any migration uncovers a missing
feature in the lib's tagged-union modifier (e.g. skill items with
`allowLuck` needing dice-chain bumps), land the lib change first in
its own PR in `dcc-core-lib`, then sync via `npm run sync-core-lib`.

## Notes for future sessions

- The pre-commit hook runs `npm run format` → `git add .` → `npm test`.
  That `git add .` **will sweep untracked files into the commit**. Before
  committing, either stash or add to `.gitignore`.
- **Lib updates require `npm run sync-core-lib`** to re-vendor
  `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/`. Commit the vendor delta separately
  from any adapter change that depends on it — two commits: `vendor:
  sync dcc-core-lib to <version> (<sha>)` then the adapter change.
  `VERSION.json` records the lib's git SHA and flags `dirty: true` if
  the lib tree had uncommitted changes at sync time (do not release
  from a dirty sync).
- `npm link @moonloch/dcc-core-lib` is no longer required for runtime
  loading (the vendored copy is used instead). It *is* still useful if
  you want TypeScript-aware IDE support against the linked source, but
  nothing in the system imports from `@moonloch/dcc-core-lib` at
  runtime anymore — all imports are relative paths into
  `module/vendor/dcc-core-lib/`.
- Sibling modules that must keep working:
  - `../../modules/dcc-qol` — attack hook consumer, reaches into
    `DiceChain.bumpDie` + `DCCRoll.createRoll`
  - `../../modules/xcc` — heaviest consumer; variant game fighting the
    system (replaces `CONFIG.Actor.documentClass` globally)
  - `../../modules/mcc-classes` — clean schema-hook consumer
  - `../../modules/dcc-crawl-classes` — clean schema-hook consumer

ok, With sufficiently high Agility, a character can wield a light-
weight secondary weapon (such as dagger, short sword, or
knife) in their off hand while using a sword or other pri-
mary weapon in their natural hand. The character typically
attacks using a smaller die, depending on the hand and
the character’s Agility, as shown on table 4-3. The table is
based on the dice chain; i.e., “-1 die” means a normal d20
roll becomes a d16. This result stacks with secondary at-
tacks, so a character with a d16 action die (for whatever
reason) would revert to d14 if affected by “-1 die” on the
table, based on the dice chain.
Two-weapon attacks are less likely to hit, but the charac-
ter may make two attack rolls where they would normally
make one. Because a character’s off hand is usually not as
strong or coordinated as their primary hand, their second-
ary attack rolls usually require a different die. Critical hits
are determined as indicated on table 4-3 (facing page).
Halflings are an exception to the two-weapon fighting rule,
as described in the halfling class entry.
A character fighting two-handed cannot use a shield (obvi-
ously).

Agility Primary Hand Die Off Hand Die Critical Hits*
8 or less -3 dice -4 dice Cannot score a critical hit fighting two-handed
9-11 -2 dice -3 dice Cannot score a critical hit fighting two-handed
12-15 -1 die -2 dice Cannot score a critical hit fighting two-handed
16-17 -1 die -1 die Primary hand scores a critical hit on a max die roll (16 on
1d16) that also beats target’s AC (no automatic hit)
18+ Normal die -1 die Primary hand scores critical hits as normal
* Warriors and others with improved crit threat ranges (i.e., those who can crit on 19-20 or better) lose that ability when fight-
  ing two-handed.

HALFLING HALFLING HALFLING
You are a little man with a big appetite and
a comfortable home, which you plan to
return to as soon as this one little quest
is completed. And once you’re home, you plan
to never leave again. The taller races might enjoy
hunting for gold and glory, but all you ask for is a
full stewpot, a cozy home, and pleasant interlocu-
tors for teatime.
Halflings are un-ambitious country-dwellers who
live in well-ordered peace and quiet. Their small
stature and modest goals let them escape the notice
of most major powers. They keep to themselves and
make contact with others only when they are inad-
vertently drawn into the affairs of “the taller races,”
as they call elves, dwarves, and humans. Halflings
prefer lives of farming, gardening, beer-brewing,
and other simple crafts. The few that take up ad-
venturing are usually traders or ne’er-do-wells who
have somehow been thrust outside the ordered na-
ture of their normal lives.
Hit points: A halfling gains 1d6 hit points at each
level. They’re small, but lucky.
Weapon training: Halflings prefer to battle with a
weapon in each hand. A halfling is trained in the
use of the club, crossbow, dagger, handaxe, javelin,
shortbow, short sword, sling, and staff. Halflings
usually wear armor – it’s much safer, you know.
Alignment: Halflings value community, family,
and kinship. They are usually lawful, or at the very
extreme, neutral. Chaotic and evil halflings are ex-
tremely rare.
Two-weapon Fighting: Halflings are masters at
two-weapon fighting, as follows:
•
Normally, two-weapon fighting depends on
the character’s Agility to be effective (see pages
94-95). A halfling is always considered to have
a minimum Agility of 16 when fighting with
two weapons. This means they roll at -1 die for
their first attack and second, based on the dice
chain (typically 1d16 for their first attack, and
1d16 for their second).
•
A halfling can fight with two equal-sized one-
handed weapons, such as two handaxes or two
short swords.
•
Unlike other characters, when fighting with
two weapons, a halfling scores a crit and auto-
matic hit on any roll of a natural 16.
•
If the halfling has an Agility score higher than
17, he instead uses the normal two-weapon
fighting rules for his Agility.
•
When fighting with two weapons, the halfling
fumbles only when both dice come up a 1.

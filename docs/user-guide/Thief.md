# Thief

## Setting Up a Thief

First, select the "Thief" sheet type:

1. Click the **Toggle Controls** button (three vertical dots) in the title bar
2. Click **Configure Sheet**
3. In the **This Sheet** dropdown, select **Thief**
4. Click **Save Sheet Configuration**

## Enabling Backstab

To use the backstab feature:

1. Click the **Toggle Controls** button in the title bar
2. Click **Config**
3. Check **Show Backstab**
4. Click **Save Config**

To enable backstab for a specific weapon:

1. Edit the weapon (click the pencil icon)
2. Check the **Backstab** checkbox
3. Enter the backstab damage dice

This will add a backstab icon next to the weapon on the Equipment tab. Backstab attacks automatically roll as critical hits with the extra backstab damage.

## Thief Skills

You can roll Thief skills (Pick Lock, Sneak Silently, Hide in Shadows, etc.) from the **Thief** tab. Each skill shows the dice and modifier used for the roll.

The Luck Die field in the Thief tab sets the die used for spending Luck on rolls (thieves can add their Luck die to any roll by spending 1 point of Luck).

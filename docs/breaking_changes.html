ESModule Migrations

An overarching goal in Version 13 is to migrate more of our JavaScript codebase into ESModules enabling it to be better organized and documented. The following API structures are now ESModules with paths in the foundry.<group> namespace. Each class can still be - for the time being - referenced under its old global name with a deprecation warning and redirect that will remain in place until Version 15.
  Canvas and Shader classes(11493)
  Container classes and the QuadTree class (11494)
  the Pings, Interaction MouseInteractionManager, RenderFlags, and CanvasAnimation classes (11497)
  The Pixi shapes and Graphics extension classes (11515)
  the geometry such as Ray, LimitedAnglePolygon, etc..., TextureLoader, and PreciseText classes (11522)
  The group and CanvasLayer classes such as InteractionLayer, PlaceablesLayer, ControlsLayer etc... (11553)
  Documents and Data

  NumberField#toInput no longer creates a range picker if the field is nullable. The behavior of NumberField#step has changed to match the behavior of the HTML input step size as part of this change. (11547), (11557)
  The initial value of the channel field for the PlaylistSound Data Model is now "". This resolves an issue that caused bulk imported playlists to assign all sounds to the "Music" channel. In addition, some labels for the playlist configuration have changed. (11605), (11604), (11603)
  Roll modes are no longer used in ChatMessage#_preCreate if options.rollMode is not set. ChatMessage.applyRollMode no longer overwrites existing whisper recipients if the roll mode is private or blind. (11442)
  Applications and User Interface

  The data structure of SceneControls#controls has changed from an array-based structure to a record of control sets and tools. This makes it much easier to work with, but it is a breaking change in the data structure transacted by the getSceneControlButtons hook. Refer to the new types declared for SceneControl and SceneControlTool. (11384)
  Added the new DatabaseOperation parameters ClientDocument.createDialog and ClientDocument.deleteDialog. (11404)
  The Game Canvas

  Gridless scenes now support circular/elliptical token shapes. (11701)
  Changed the return type of TextureExtractor#extract with compression mode NONE from Promise<Uint8ClampedArray|undefined> to Promise<{pixels: Uint8ClampedArray|undefined, width: number, height: number, out?: ArrayBuffer}>. (11687)
